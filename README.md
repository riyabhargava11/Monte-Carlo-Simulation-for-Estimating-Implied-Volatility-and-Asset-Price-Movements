# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Estimating-Implied-Volatility-and-Asset-Price-Movements

## Description
This project leverages Monte Carlo simulation to estimate daily price changes of an asset based on its implied volatility (IV). Using real-time options data retrieved from Yahoo Finance, it calculates the 1/2/3 standard deviation implied moves, offering insight into potential price ranges for the asset over a given time horizon. The simulation is useful for traders and analysts interested in understanding possible price movement scenarios under market volatility.

The results are visualized in a histogram showing the distribution of simulated prices, providing an intuitive understanding of the assetâ€™s future price range.

Note: This project for written for Yale's BENG 424 (Spring 2024): Topics in Systems and Computational Biology, a class on using algorithms such as Monte Carlo and Markov Chains to predict cell or tissue fates in biological systems.
